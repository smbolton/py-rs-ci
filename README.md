# Rust C-ABI Library Template

A minimal template for building a Rust library and calling it from C-ABI
langauges including C, JavaScript (Node.js), Lua, and Python.

The minimal library, [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs), includes a landing pad to catch
panics in the Rust code and prevent them from cross the FFI boundary. The main
function ``rust_function()`` expects to receive a C string as an argument, and
returns a pointer to a C-formatted struct containing a result code and a C
string message or payload:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct CallResult {
   status: i32,       // 0: success,      1: failure,         2: panic caught
   text: *mut c_char  // success message, failure message, or panic message
}
```

The landing pad will return whatever its protected code returns, unless a
panic occurs, in which case, it returns a ``status`` of 2 and a ``text``
message describing the panic.

Since the ``CallResult`` struct is allocated by Rust, it must be freed by
Rust, so the calling application must call ``free_result()`` to release the
memory.

Also included is a Travis-CI configuration for building a Rust library as part
of a project written in another language (in this case, Python). At present,
the [Travis Rust documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/rust/)
describes how to use their service for projects that are primarily Rust-based
('language: rust'), but not how to add Rust components to an existing (e.g.
'language: python') project.

## C

No makefile is included for the ``c_test.c`` test application, but it can be
built and run somewhat like this:

```sh
$ cargo build
$ gcc -Wall -O2 -o c_test c_test.c -L target/debug -lrust_c_abi_library_template
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=target/debug ./ffi_test
```

## Lua

The ``lua_test.lua`` test application was tested using Lua 5.3 with
Pierre Chapuis's fork of [luaffi](https://github.com/catwell/luaffi), which
adds Lua 5.3 to James McKaskill's (unmaintained?) [version](https://github.com/jmckaskill/luaffi).
Either McKaskill's version or the [FaceBook
fork](https://github.com/facebook/luaffifb) will probably work with older
versions of Lua.

Example:

```sh
$ # install luaffi using your favorite method
$ cargo build
$ lua lua_test.lua
```

## Node.js

The ``node_test.js`` test application was tested using Node 6.9.1 and the
[ffi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi),
[ref](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ref), and
[ref-struct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ref-struct) packages.

Example:

```sh
$ cargo build
$ npm install
$ node node_test.js
```
